## Selfie Filters Using Facial Landmarks 


This deep learning application in python can put various sunglasses on a detected face (I am calling them 'Selfie Filters') by finding the Facial Keypoints (15 unique points). 

These keypoints mark important areas of the face - the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc.
